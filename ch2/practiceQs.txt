    range repeats the for loop 10 times
    range(0,10) repeats the loop, starts at 0 and ends when iterator = 10
    range(0,10,1) same as above, moving in increments of 1

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do

    round() rounds takes 2 arguments, number to round and decimal places to round to
    x=round(5.76543) // 6
    x=round(5.76543,1) // 5.8
    x=round(5.76543,2) // 5.77
    x=round(5.76543,5) // 5.76543

    abs() returns the absolute value of a number
    x = abs(-7.25) //7.25
